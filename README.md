# 1. How do I approach designing software?

## What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

### This project help me discover how to work with OpenGL. It has helped me learn how to incrementally develop an application as well as work in 3D space, add lighting to a scene, and texture objects.

## What design process did you follow for your project work?

### The design process was all done small bits at a time. Each week we had an assignment that contributed to our final scene bit by bit, relieving the total load we had to do at the end. A big part of the process also included trial and error, especially when placing objects in the 3D scene, as it would take me a couple tries to get the coordinates correct.

## How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

### The tactics learned can be applied in future work by understanding programs take time to develop. As I progress further in my degree, the programs I'm writing are becoming larger and larger, leading me to not stress out if I can't get the program working in one sitting.

# How do I approach developing programs?

## What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

### The biggest strategy I used I already discussed a bit, but it is developing incrementally. It is hard to estimate how many hours I put into this project in total but the finishing touches alone took mulitple days with me working on it for over 4 hours a day. This approach is still new to me because I often want to complete what I'm working on hastily, but that leads to poor code quality and easy mistakes, so taking a step back to breathe beteween sessions is very useful.

## How did iteration factor into your development?

### I think iteration made this project manageable. Between me working between iterations I would often think about what I was going to accomplish during the next session I would work on the project.

## How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project's completion?

### My approach evolved by me not worrying much if I didn't accomplish what I wanted to in the session. Some concepts and sessions are harder than others, meaning that I didn't accurately asses how much time I would need to complete them.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

### I still have multiple semester until I graduate so having the knowledge from this class will help me in those classes by giving me a foundation to work on when working with computer graphics. I'm not sure what classes I can use this knowledge in but when any of them involve visualizations I am happy to have taken this class.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

### Most programs made today use a user interface or build a 3D world in someway. Eventually I would like to contribute to game development, software development, or data sceince, and all of those can involve making a 3D scene for an application. I am excited to see where this knowledge will take me.
